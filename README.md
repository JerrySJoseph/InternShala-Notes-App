# Internshala Assessment
This is an assignment for the post of SDE-intern in internshala

## Problem Statement
Design and develop a simple Notes Android app, which has the following features:
1. Use only 1 activity for the entire app. Use fragments for different screens.
2. When a user starts the app, a login screen appears (if the user is not logged in). Login can only happen through Google Sign-In. Use shared preferences/ SQLite to track logged-in users.
3. Once the user logs in, display all notes of the logged-in user (complete notes, not preview). Use Recyclerview to display notes.
4. Add a button to add a new note.
5. Allow users to update a note. 
6. Allow the user to delete a note.

## Final prototype
